## Behavior

> What the function does - inputs and outputs

- **The Function**
  - [ ] The function's name is clear and helpful
  - [ ] The parameter names are clear and helpful
  - [ ] Default parameters are used if possible
- **JSDoc Comment**
  - [ ] The docstring is well-formatted
  - [ ] There are no spelling mistakes
  - [ ] The description of the function's behavior is clear
  - [ ] All parameters are documented with types
  - [ ] Documented parameter names match the function's parameter names
  - [ ] Parameters have a good description
  - [ ] If default parameters are used, they are the correct type
  - [ ] The return value is documented with a type
  - [ ] The return value has a clear description
- **README**
  - [ ] The documentation is rendered into the README
  - [ ] Docs were generated just before pushing
  - [ ] Docs in the README matches the JSDoc comment
  - [ ] The README contains at least one use case
- **Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Unit tests are present
  - [ ] There are at least 8 test cases
  - [ ] All `describe`s and `it`s have clear and helpful names
  - [ ] All test names actually describe what is being tested
  - [ ] Tests are grouped logically using `describe`
  - [ ] There is only one `expect` inside every `it`
  - [ ] There is no logic (loops, conditionals, ...) in the test cases
  - [ ] Side-effects are tested, if necessary
  - [ ] Tests were run just before pushing
  - [ ] All tests pass (`file-name.pass.txt`)
  - [ ] Tricky edge cases are tested (extra credit)

## Strategy

> The logic behind the solution

- **The Function**
  - [ ] Variables have names that help understand the strategy
  - [ ] Spacing and formatting help to understand the strategy
  - [ ] The code is written as simply and clearly as possible
  - [ ] Comments _are_ used to label important goals in your strategy
  - [ ] Comments _are not_ used to describe how the code works
- **README**
  - [ ] There is an explanation of the solution's strategy in the README
  - [ ] The explanation is clear and understandable
  - [ ] The explanation actually matches the function that was written

## Implementation

> The code used to write the solution

- **Formatting**
  - [ ] The code was formatted just before pushing
  - [ ] No errors occurred while formatting the code
- **Linting**
  - [ ] There should be no linting errors or warnings in the `file-name.lint.txt` file
  - [ ] Spelling should be correct in all code, comments and docstrings
  - [ ] The code was linted just before pushing
- **The solution file**
  - [ ] Has a JSDoc comment
  - [ ] Has an exported function
  - [ ] Does no other code or comments (you can use the sandbox for saving extra ideas)
- **The function body _Should_ ...**
  - [ ] Be well and consistently formatted
  - [ ] Have clear and helpful variable names
  - [ ] Declare variables in the smallest scope possible
  - [ ] Be a simple and readable implementation
  - [ ] Use short comments to describe the strategy

- **The function body should _Not_ ...**
  - [ ] Have extra comments that are not about strategy or important decisions
